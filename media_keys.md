# Make VolumeUp, VolumeDown keys work
## Problem description
- Distributions affected:
    - Ubuntu Mate 16.04.3 LTS
- VolumeUp (Fn-F4) and VolumeDown (Fn-F3) keys are **detected** and produce OSD (On Screen Display), but the volume itself does not change
- Update: this problem seems to occur **only** if there are **more than one sound card** - i.e. on the RDP Thinbook, if snd_hdmi_lpe_audio module is **NOT** blacklisted. If the snd_hdmi_lpe_audio module is blacklisted, and there is only one (built-in) sound card, VolumeUp (Fn-F4) and VolumeDown (Fn-F3) keys work **FINE**.
- This is definitely an upstream bug. It does not occur on standard Ubuntu flavor.
This problem does not occur on Ubuntu Mate 17.10 (Artful Aardvark), presumably because my remastering process automatically blacklists the snd_hdmi_lpe_audio because of the pulseaudio version present.

## Solution / workaround
- Open System --> Preferences --> Hardware --> Keyboard Shortcuts
- VolumeUp
    - Click on ```Add``` (new keyboard shortcut)
    - Give it a name like 'VolumeUp'
    - Command should be ```amixer -D pulse sset Master 5%+```
    - Click ```Apply```
    - Click on shortcut column of newly added shortcut (under ```Custom Shortcuts```)
    - Press Fn-F4
    - You will get a warning message indicating key is already assigned to ```Volume up```
    - Choose ```Reassign```
- VolumeDown
    - Click on ```Add``` (new keyboard shortcut)
    - Give it a name like 'VolumeDown'
    - Command should be ```amixer -D pulse sset Master 5%-```
    - Click ```Apply```
    - Click on shortcut column of newly added shortcut (under ```Custom Shortcuts```)
    - Press Fn-F3
    - You will get a warning message indicating key is already assigned to ```Volume down```
    - Choose ```Reassign```

## Shortcomings of solution
- Volume goes up and down perfectly, but you do not get the On Screen Display (OSD)
- OSD is produced from within mate-settings-daemon
- mate-settings-daemon is executing the wrong command, and does not provide:
    - A way to change the command executed for ```Volume up``` and ```Volume down``` events
    - A way to create the same or similar OSD for custom shortcuts created

# Conclusion
- This should be filed as an upstream bug against Ubuntu Mate / mate-settings-daemon
- If you use Ubuntu Mate and you have found a different / better solution, send me a pull request
